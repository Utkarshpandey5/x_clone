# X (twitter) clone

Full-stack twitter clone using MERN stack, tanstack query (react query), tailwind css & cloudinary. I made this project to practice tanstack query and it turned out to be great!


## Demo

https://x.com/53Priyanshu/status/1815385964036124695

P.S.: I had deployed it on render.com, but as it's a clone, my deployment was suspended by render, now I can't deploy it on any other platform as well as it'd be a trademark violation and will eventually get me banned on that platform.

## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Priyanshu-Ganatra/X-clone.git
```

Install dependencies (first in the root directory for backend/server)

```bash
  npm i
```
Then go to the frontend directory

```bash
  cd frontend
```
Install dependencies for the frontend

```bash
  npm i
```

Start the frontend dev server

```bash
  npm run dev
```

Go back to the root directory

```bash
  cd ..
```

Now start the backend dev server

```bash
  npm run dev
```

**That's it you're done with the setup, now just go and try out the project, Thank you.**
